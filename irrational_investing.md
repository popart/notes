# Pattern matching
- Human brain sees trends & patterns in randomness
  - coin flip: 2 in a row leads to expecatation of 3rd
  - stocks: 2 days in a row looks like a trend, don't get caught!
- Human brain tries to predict random bad events
  - green light 4/5 times, red light 1/5 times
  - prize if you guess green or red
  - humans try to guess red
  - pigeons guess green every time, maximizing expectation
  - stocks: stop trying to short!
- Result:
  - dumb expectation based on "trends"

# Memories
- Human brain strongly remembers unexpected rewards
  - attempt to repeat outcome based on unconscious pattern matching
- Human brain strongly remembers losses
- recency bias
- Result:
  - bias against steady expected gains (no emotion)
  - irrational fear (more than necessary)
  - irrational hope (not solid foundation)

# Prices are not physical
- Prices do not have momentum.
- Prices do not behave like anything in nature your brain is adapted for.
  - All your intuition is wrong.
- Prices are chaotic. For you, random.

# Feelings
- repeated exposure
  - teaches you that this thing is not dangerous => good feelings
  - brand premium [DIS, GOOG, ...]
  - if you pay premium for brand-name drugs, why not stocks
- illusion of control
  - just wagering makes you more confident
    - harder to recognize bad investments when you own them
  - superstitions, rituals
- illusion of safety
  - brain recognizes safety pattern => takes more risk
  - winning streak => simplistic assumption it will continue
  - is pattern actually causal?
  - do you realize you're taking more risk?
- house money effect
  - you're still losing money (that you earned!)

# winning streaks
- company acquires another company, makes money
  => more likely to acquire another company
- investor buys a stock, makes money
  => more likely to buy more of that stock
  => momentum / price bubble
  - e.g. slot machine player won't leave a lucky seat
- making money => harder to perceive when game changes
  - suddenly losing money but continue
- don't forget most trades are algorithms though

# hindsight bias
- easy to re-imagine what you thought was going to happen ex-ante
  to match the ex-post reality
- should keep notes and review them

# can you beat market?
- 70% of market is institutional
- <50% of hedge funds beat the market
- so it's not like the game is so rigged?

# Checklist
- Am I chasing a trend?
- Am I afraid? (of missing out or of losing)
- Am I hoping for a big win instead of small incremental gains?
- Do I think I know something the market does not?
- Do I think I know everything the market knows?
- Am I answering an easier question?
  - "Could X happen someday?"

# Solution
- Better don't touch anything, than acting irrationally
