# Decision Making
1. Get the facts
  - postpone making an actual decision as long as possible
  - pretend you are collecting info for someone else
  - argue both sides of the issue
2. Imagine worst-case scenario
  - emotionally come to grips w/ worst-case
3. Now think about steps to improve on worst-case
4. Now you can act
  - b/c of steps 2 & 3, each action is a relief
  - necessary to avoid pain, thus easy
