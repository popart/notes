If everyone is passive investing:
  - then they are blindly putting money into the same 500 stocks...
  - which inflates the prices of those stocks
  - which makes passive investing look like it creates returns
  - a.k.a. a bubble or a ponzi scheme

70% of all trading is algorithmic
  - maybe 10% is fundamental stock picking?

What Moves Stock Prices? Cutler, Poterba, & Summers
  - not macroeconomic news!
  - mostly endogenous (even in 1989)
