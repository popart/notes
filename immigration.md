Economics - pro open borders
- immigrants create jobs

Happy situation:
- labor is the limiting resource in production
- everyone needed to work
- more workers => more production

BUT can't immigrants also just displace existing jobs?
- Replace $10 worker w/ $5 worker
- Now I have $5 surplus I can spend on original worker.
  - or I reduce price so consumer has $5 extra
- New worker has $5 they can spend
  - they can send it back home instead of spending in country
- So far no new money created

Unhappy situation:
- surplus of labor
- a few people + capital => all the production anyone needs
- wages = the calories you spent working + a little more
  - doesn't even have to be enough to stay alive,
  - just enough to die slower

Wealth redistribution
- more people => dilution

What really matters?
- unemployment rate
